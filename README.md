You can find the paper by clicking on its [DoI https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2023.3283707](https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2023.3283707).

Also, you can find the presentation given at RTSS'23 at the [following link](https://github.com/ebni/periodic-LET/docs/2023RTSS_WaP_slides.pdf).


### Requirements
You should only need Python. If you haven't it, just
```
sudo apt install python3
```

### Launching

Launching the script should be as easy as
```
chmod +x periodic-LET.py
./periodic-LET.py
```
If you want to modify the input, just enter the data in the script. If you want a smarter way to enter the inputs, what about contributing? It would be my first pull request to handle, I'm excited. :-)
