We hope we can say soon it is accepted :-)
If you want to have a look to the paper, just send me an email.

### Requirements
You should only need Python. If you haven't it, just
```
sudo apt install python3
```

### Launching

Launching the script should be as easy as
```
chmod +x periodic-LET.py
./periodic-LET.py
```
If you want to modify the input, just enter the data in the script. If you want a smarted way to enter the inputs, what about contributing? It would be my first pull request to handle, I'm excited. :-)
